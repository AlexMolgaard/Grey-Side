We want to give users the ability to be independent of limitations that the real world can have when it comes to employment.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Grey Side, a user does not have to have a resume, work experience, references, or do an interview just to be able to start making money. All it takes is a computer, an internet connection, a good idea, and willingness to make the idea happen. We help take care of the rest.\r\n\r\nThis repository contains code for the homepage that will be the center of where all Grey Side products reside.It will contain information about the company's mission and philosophy, associated products, and it will give the user the ability to read up on the basic structure of how all the products will work\r\n\r\nEach project is linked to their respective repositories.
