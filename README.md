# Grey-Side Home
## What do we do?
We make tools that people can use to make money on the Internet. We want to give users the ability to be independent of limitations that the real world can have when it comes to employment.

When it comes to Grey Side, a user does not have to have a resume, work experience, references, or do an interview just to be able to start making money. All it takes is a computer, an internet connection, a good idea, and willingness to make the idea happen. We help take care of the rest.

This repository contains code for the homepage that will be the center of where all Grey Side products reside.It will contain information about the company's mission and philosophy, associated products, and it will give the user the ability to read up on the basic structure of how all the products will work

Each project is linked to their respective repositories. Each project has a wiki that goes into deeper detail about the project that its under.

The different repositories are as follows:

## [Advertising](https://github.com/s24569/Advertising)


## [Game Space](https://github.com/s24569/The-Game-Space):

* Gives users the ability to build, market, and make money off of games
* UI is designed to be incredibly simple in order to minimize learning curve(users should not have to know any programming in advance)
